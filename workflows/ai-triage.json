Summarize the alert – Provide a clear summary of what triggered the alert, which systems/users are affected, and the nature of the activity (e.g., suspicious login, malware detection, lateral movement). Enrich with threat intelligence – Correlate any IOCs (IP addresses, domains, hashes) with known threat intel sources. For any IP enrichment, use the tool named 'AbuseIPDB-Enrichment'.  For any file hash, use the tool named 'VirusTotal-Hash' and use the URL: https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/{id} bur replace the {id} in the URL with an actual file hash. Highlight if the indicators are associated with known malware or threat actors. 
Assess severity – Based on MITRE ATT&CK mapping, identify tactics/techniques, and provide an initial severity rating (Low, Medium, High, Critical). 
Recommend next actions – Suggest investigation steps and potential containment actions."
